## Instructions
To demonstrate the app, follow these steps:

1. Build and download the application to the WICED board.
2. Open the BT/BLE Profile ClientControl application
     - [UART] Open the port for WICED HCI for the device.(Default baud rate configured in the application is defined by the BSP HCI\_UART\_DEAULT\_BAUD #define, usually either 3M or 115200 depending on the board UART capabilities.)
     - [SPI] Open the port for WICED PUART for the SPI master device (using 115200 baudrate and without flow control). Refer the instructions below for SPI setup (supported on 20719B2/20721B2 only)
3. Use the ClientControl application to send various commands as mentioned below.
4. Run the BTSpy program to view protocol and application traces.

## SPI as transport instead of UART

1. Download uart_spi_bridge application on a 20706A2 board.
2. Connect SPI pins as indicatd below,

    Master (20706A2):

    - SPI CLK     - P36(J19.6)
    - SPI MOSI    - P0(J22.6)
    - SPI MISO    - P25(J19.4)
    - SPI CS      - P26(J22.4)
    - SLAVE READY - P12(J22.7)
    - GND         - J19.8

    Slave:

    - SPI CLK     - P38(D13)
    - SPI MOSI    - P28(D11)
    - SPI MISO    - P01(D12)
    - SPI CS      - P07(D10)
    - SLAVE READY - P06(D8)
    - GND         - J3.4

3. Ensure that pin config array has the following pins configured correctly,

    [PLATFORM_GPIO_1] = {WICED_P01, spi_0_miso_0_TRIGGER_IN},
    [PLATFORM_GPIO_4] = {WICED_P06, WICED_SPI_1_SLAVE_READY},
    [PLATFORM_GPIO_5] = {WICED_P07, spi_0_cs_0_TRIGGER_IN},
    [PLATFORM_GPIO_11] = {WICED_P28, spi_0_mosi_0_TRIGGER_IN},
    [PLATFORM_GPIO_15] = {WICED_P38, spi_0_clk_0_TRIGGER_IN},

BR/EDR Audio Source and AVRC Target:

- The Watch app can demonstrate how use to BR/EDR Audio Source and AVRC TG profiles.
- Audio Source can use I2S interrupt or SW timer to decide the timing to read PCM.
  For media type as 'I2S input', it will use I2S interrupt, and you need to configure 4 gpios as WICED I2S PINs.
  For media type as 'Wav file' or 'Sine wave', it will use SW timer by calling wiced\_audio\_use\_sw\_timing(1).
  In general, if using WICED HCI UART to transmit audio, it must either allocate I2S pins on unused pins for
  I2S interrupt OR use wiced\_audio\_use\_sw\_timing(1) to enable SW timer.
- Use the buttons in the ClientControl AV Source tab.
- To play a sine wave sample, set the audio frequency to the desired value (48kHz, 44.1kHz, etc.)
  and select the Media type as 'Sine Wave' in the UI. In this case, built-in sine wave audio is played.
- To play music from a .wav file, select the Media type as File, browse and select a .wav file,
  and set the audio frequency to the desired value (48kHz, 44.1kHz, etc.)
  In this case, audio for the .wav file is routed over WICED HCI UART to the WICED board.<br>
  sinc\_44100\_16\_L440\_R1000\_50s\_stereo.wav in app folder can be used as the input of 44.1KHz 16bits stereo samples.
- To play music from a .mp3 file, select the Media type as File, browse and select a .mp3 file,
  and set the audio frequency to the desired value (48kHz, 44.1kHz, etc.)
  In this case, audio for the .mp3 file is routed over WICED HCI UART to the WICED board.
  sinc\_44100\_mono.mp3, sinc\_44100\_stereo.mp3, sinc\_48000\_mono.mp3 and sinc\_48000\_stereo.mp3 in MP3\_sample folder
  can be used as the input of 44.1KHz/48kHz Mono/stereo samples.
  Use only the .mp3 files provided with the application in the 'MP3_samples' folder.
- To play music from the Line-In jack, select the Media type as 'I2S input' and set the
  audio frequency to the desired value (48kHz, 44.1kHz, etc.)
  In this case, audio from Line-In is encoded into I2S signals and routed to the WICED board.
- Put an audio sink device such as BT headphone/speaker in pairable mode.
- Click on the "Start" button from the "BR/EDR Discovery" combo box in ClientControl to find the audio sink device.
- Select the peer device in the BR/EDR Discovery combo box.

## ModusToolbox Tools

Source code generation tools installed by ModusToolbox installer:

- Device Configurator:
      A GUI tool to create custom pin mappings for your device.
- Bluetooth Configurator:
      A GUI tool to create and configure the LE GATT Database and BR/EDR SDP records for your application.

## Using BSPs (platforms)

BTSDK BSPs are located in the \mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ folder by default.

#### a. Selecting an alternative BSP

The application makefile has a default BSP. See "TARGET". The makefile also has a list of other BSPs supported by the application. See "SUPPORTED_TARGETS". To select an alternative BSP, use Library Manager from the Quick Panel to deselect the current BSP and select an alternate BSP. Then right-click the newly selected BSP and choose 'Set Active'.  This will automatically update TARGET in the application makefile.

#### b. Custom BSP

**Complete BSP**

To create and use a complete custom BSP that you want to use in applications, perform the following steps:

1. Select an existing BSP you wish to use as a template from the list of supported BSPs in the mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ folder.
2. Make a copy in the same folder and rename it. For example mtb\shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_mybsp.<br/>
   **Note:** This can be done in the system File Explorer and then refresh the workspace in Eclipse to see the new project.  Delete the .git sub-folder from the newly copied folder before refreshing in Eclipse.
   If done in the IDE, an error dialog may appear complaining about items in the .git folder being out of sync.  This can be resolved by deleting the .git sub-folder in the newly copied folder.

3. In the new mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_mybsp folder, rename the existing/original (BSP).mk file to mybsp.mk.
4. In the application makefile, set TARGET=mybsp and add it to SUPPORTED\_TARGETS as well as TARGET\_DEVICE\_MAP.  For example: mybsp/20819A1
5. Update design.modus for your custom BSP if needed using the **Device Configurator** link under **Configurators** in the Quick Panel.
6. Update the application makefile as needed for other custom BSP specific attributes and build the application.

**Custom Pin Configuration Only - Multiple Apps**

To create a custom pin configuration to be used by multiple applications using an existing BSP that supports Device Configurator, perform the following steps:

1. Create a folder COMPONENT\_(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus in the existing BSP folder. For example mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_CYW920819EVB-02\COMPONENT\_my\_design\_modus
2. Copy the file design.modus from the reference BSP COMPONENT\_bsp\_design\_modus folder under mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ and place the file in the newly created COMPONENT\_(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus folder.
3. In the application makefile, add the following two lines<br/>
   DISABLE\_COMPONENTS+=bsp\_design\_modus<br/>
   COMPONENTS+=(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus<br/>
   (for example COMPONENTS+=my\_design\_modus)
4. Update design.modus for your custom pin configuration if needed using the **Device Configurator** link under **Configurators** in the Quick Panel.
5. Building of the application will generate pin configuration source code under a GeneratedSource folder in the new COMPONENT\_(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus folder.

**Custom Pin Configuration Only - Per App**

To create a custom configuration to be used by a single application from an existing BSP that supports Device Configurator, perform the following steps:

1. Create a folder COMPONENT\_(BSP)\_design\_modus in your application. For example COMPONENT\_CYW920721B2EVK-03\_design\_modus
2. Copy the file design.modus from the reference BSP under mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ and place the file in this folder.
3. In the application makefile, add the following two lines<br/>
   DISABLE\_COMPONENTS+=bsp\_design\_modus<br/>
   COMPONENTS+=(BSP)\_design\_modus<br/>
   (for example COMPONENTS+=CYW920721B2EVK-03\_design\_modus)
4. Update design.modus for your custom pin configuration if needed using the **Device Configurator** link under **Configurators** in the Quick Panel.
5. Building of the application will generate pin configuration source code under the GeneratedSource folder in your application.


## Using libraries

The libraries needed by the app can be found in in the mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\libraries folder. To add an additional library to your application, launch the Library Manager from the Quick Panel to add a library. Then update the makefile variable "COMPONENTS" of your application to include the library. For example:<br/>
   COMPONENTS += fw\_upgrade\_lib
